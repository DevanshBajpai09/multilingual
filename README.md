# FAQ Multilingual Web Application

This is a **Django-based FAQ web application** where users can view FAQs in multiple languages. It allows administrators to add frequently asked questions (FAQs) and their answers, and users can view them in their preferred language.

**Note:** I tried deploying the project on Heroku, but there is an error during deployment.

---

## Features

- **Multilingual Support**: FAQs are available in different languages.
- **Admin Interface**: Admins can add, edit, and delete FAQs through the Django admin panel.
- **Cache Support**: FAQs are cached using Redis for better performance.
- **Rich Text Editor**: The FAQ questions and answers can be formatted using the CKEditor.
- **REST API**: Exposes a REST API for fetching FAQs in a specified language.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django (Python web framework)
- **Cache**: Redis (for caching FAQ translations)
- **Web Server**: Gunicorn (for deployment on Heroku)
- **Styling**: Bootstrap and custom CSS
- **Rich Text Editor**: CKEditor for better formatting of FAQ content
- **Deployment**: Heroku (for live hosting)
